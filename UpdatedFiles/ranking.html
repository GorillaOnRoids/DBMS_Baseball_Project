            Member 1: Kyle Pollack <br>
            My teammates and I agree that I handled X% of the overall project. My specific tasks included:
            <br>
            Task 1: I developed the table on "Stat Report" that displays the types of pitches and their desired stats <br>
            Task 2: I created the upload csv file function to the site <br>
            Task 3: I helped create the format and base layer of the html/css files <br>
            <br> <br>
            Member 2: Mickey Alling <br>
            My teammates and I agree that I handled Y% of the overall project. My specific tasks included:
            <br>
            Task 1: I designed and implemented the program module that created the scatterplot visualization using
            Chart.js to display the relationship between two pitching metrics. 
            <br>
            Task 2: I developed the primary data parsing and transformation functions responsible for converting the raw CSV output 
            into a structured JSON format that the Chart.js scatterplot could consume. 
            <br>
            Task 3: I helped write the script.js general application logic that handles view 
            switching and coordinates data flow between the uploaded file and the various visualization modules.

            My teammates and I agree that I handled Y% of the overall project. My specific tasks included:
            <br>
            Task 1: I designed the line graph tables on the progression tab to reflect accurate AvgVelocity and Strike % per player <br>
            Task 2: I wrote the final project write up and made sure to include precise details about the initial set up, process, and functionality of the web application. <br>
            Task 3: I researched GCP in order to set up an instance, SQL database, and make a connection between GCP and our code to provide clean data <br>
